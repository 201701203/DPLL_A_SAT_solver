# DPLL_A_SAT_solver

SAT is the problem of determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given formula. SAT is NP-complete Problem. We can Solve the Problem using Truth-table but it isn’t efficient for Formula having large number of variable. DPLL is an algorithm which solves this problem. Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) algorithm is backtracking based approach. DPLL uses Unit Propagation for Simplification.
